# Magazine-style-layout

This is an experimental project to create a web design that we often find on magazine pages - those that only text contents create a layout design of the page. The layout I particularly hope to deliver is the one with a quote, placed in middle of two text columns. The example screen-shot of ELLE is also in 'images' file to reference if the url isn't loading below.

## Challenges
So far the basic layout's been built up by using 'grid' property and a quotation div is centered as I want it to be, BUT since the 'quotation div' is overlapped on top of two columns, texts also overlap.
